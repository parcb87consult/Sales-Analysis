### The Analysis of the Sales Data
This include some interesting codes and features that were scripted and engineered during the exploratory data analysis (EDA) phase.


### Results/Findings
he insight drawn from the data and its analysis were summarized as follows:

1. The company's profits were high in the month of March and October and recorded a negative profit in April and May.

2. Product category 3 is the best performing category in terms of sales and revenue.

3. Customer segmentation with high lifetime value (LTV) should be targeted for marketing efforts.


### Recommendation
ased on the analysis performed, we recommend following actions to be taking:

- Invest in marketing through promotions during the peak season to maximize revenue
- Focus on expanding and promoting product category A.
- Implement a customer segmentation strategy to target high-LTV customers effectively.


### Limitations
We removed all zero values from the budget and revenue columns because they would have affected the accuracy of our conclusions from the analysis.
